# Sales.Price.Estimate.-.Regression.Model
Estimate the sales price given the product attributes (attractive price on a marketplace)

The dataset describes the sales activity from a marketplace to exchange second-hand products between buyers and sellers. The first columns are describing the characteristics of the products, then 2 columns are measuring the popularity of the products, and the last columns indicate the time online, if the product was sold and the associated sales price.

Based on this dataset, our objective is to estimate a sales price given the product attributes. This estimated sales price should be both attractive for buyers and sellers, in order to maximise the number of transactions in the marketplace, but also to fullfill the best customer satisfaction.
